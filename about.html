			<div class="pwrapper">
				<p>My childhood passion for rocks led me to Western State Colorado Univeristy to pursue a degree in Geology. There I explored diverse geologic environments and was introduced to GIS. This led me to the University of Wisconsin-Madison Master in GIS and Web Programming. This degree is achieved online and is my current educational pursuit. </p>
				<p>As a GIS Analyst at Johnson Outdoors, I'm working with surveyed bathymetric data, older DRG data, and foreign bathymetric data. Creating bathymetric maps for lakes across the United States and Canada is a fulfilling line of work as most of the lakes are not properly or accurately mapped. Breaking down the barriers of older technologies and applying new techniques to surveying paired with monitoring lake data procurement is a ground breaking and ever changing line of work.</p>
				<p> In my spare time I enjoy fishing, hiking, recreational biking, puzzling, painting, and finiding ways to incorporate maps into my home decor.</p>
